        <h2>Why do we process this personal data?</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            We want to be clear about what we do with personal data and how we
            make sure our data processing is lawful. This section describes our
            reasons for processing personal data and the lawful basis we rely on
            for such processing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before we dive into that, we want to provide a brief explanation of
            what the phrase &rsquo;lawful basis&lsquo; means. The law requires
            us to have an appropriate basis to process personal data. There are
            a number of bases available and we must choose the most appropriate
            one before processing data. If we can&lsquo;t find an appropriate
            lawful basis, we won&lsquo;t process the data. Simple. Most
            commonly, we&lsquo;ll use your personal data in the following
            circumstances:
          </p>
          <List>
            <li>
              Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into
              or have entered into with you
            </li>
            <li>
              Where it&lsquo;s necessary for our legitimate interests (or those
              of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not
              override those interests
            </li>
            <li>Where we need to meet a legal or regulatory obligation</li>
          </List>

          <p>
            Generally, we don&lsquo;t rely on consent as a lawful basis for
            processing personal data; if we do, we&lsquo;ll explicitly ask for
            your consent. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any
            time, if this is the lawful basis we use to process personal data.
          </p>

          <p>
            We may process your personal data on more than one lawful ground,
            depending on why we&lsquo;re using your data. Please contact us if
            you need details about the specific legal ground we&lsquo;re relying
            on to process your personal data, where more than one ground is set
            out in the table below.
          </p>

          <div>
            <h3>Change of purpose</h3>
            <p>
              We&lsquo;ll only use your personal data for the purposes we
              collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it
              for another purpose which is compatible with the original purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose,
              we&lsquo;ll notify you and explain the legal basis that allows us
              to do so. Please note that we may process your personal data
              without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above
              rules, where this is required or permitted by law.

            Generally, you don&lsquo;t have to pay a fee to exercise any of
            these rights, and we'll confirm completion of your request within
            one calendar month. However, we may charge a reasonable fee or
            extend our timeline for responding in cases where a request is
            clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may
            refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
            We&lsquo;ll always notify you in the event this occurs.
